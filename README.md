# testState
A useful utility wrapper to test the state with custom comparisions for development environment. Still in progress.

## Use-case
Ideal scenario would be to check state after some data fetching,addition,deletiona and editing. If it matches our test case that we have supplied, then it passes the test.

## Further vision
Features like versioning and audit for testing state could be enabled via feedback from users.
